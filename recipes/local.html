        <h1>Local Recipes</h1>
        <p>Purchasing local foods supports the Ghanaian economy in diverse ways. 
            Purchasing fresh local foods from your typical markets instead of those 
            huge supermarket chains that import most of their foods will help place 
            money in the hands of local farmers.
