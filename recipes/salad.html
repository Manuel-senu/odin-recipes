        <h3>Green Salad Recipes</h3>
        <p>Green salads don’t have to be boring, and these recipes are here to prove it! I often make these salad recipes for a healthy lunch, but they’re great cookout and dinner side dishes too.</p>

        <h3>Spring Salad</h3>
        <p>This beet, apple, and goat cheese salad would be at home on any holiday table. To get ahead, roast the beets and make the balsamic vinaigrette a day or two in advance.</p>

        <h3>Homemade Caesar Salad</h3>
        <p>Juicy roasted grapes, toasted almonds, and shaved Parm give this simple salad an 
            elevated twist. Everything you love about the classic salad—crunchy croutons! crisp romaine! lots of Parmesan cheese!—but with an easier homemade Caesar dressing. 
            Greek yogurt creates its creamy, tangy base.</p>
